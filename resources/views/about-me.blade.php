    <h6>Hi, I'm Yuna. I'm currently studying Informatics Engineering in University Of Trunojoyo Madura. 
        I'm from Mojokerto, one of the districts in East Java. So... 
        What made me study at UTM and why did i choose Informatics Engineering as my major? well, 
        that's all seems like destiny wkwk. Should i get some tea and then take a seat andd tell all? nvm, ofc that's all 
        made by the results of the SBIEMPITIEN idk how to tell them sowrry. 
        and the answer for the question why did i choose Informatics Engineering, bc my mom wanted that. Thats it. </h6>
    <h6>I like watching anime, listening music especially Kpop and J-Pop/Rock.
        so far my fav anime movie is 'Kimi No Nawa', and my fav song is Love song by TXT.
        Thanks!

    <h2>Suka Duka Praktikum PAW</h2>

        maybe cukup laporan saja, big no to asistensi ^^
